//cadidate parameters for query
All surgical discharges,  for adult patients (>18 years) inpatient, all admissions, any listed ICD-10-PCS procedure codes for an operating room procedure; 
and the principlal procedure occurring within 2 days (Mallory). Outcomes of interest were patients who had a diagnosis or procedural code for CPA (ICD-9 = 427.5), respiratory arrest (RA, ICD-9 = 799.1), or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR, ICD-9 procedure = 99.60 or CPT = 92950) entered into their billing record. Patients meeting these diagnostic criteria should be included in our definition of CPRA (Paul?). 
Patients were excluded if they: (1) were outpatients, (2) had an admitting diagnosis of CPRA (based on ICD-9-CM codes), (3) had pre-existing acute respiratory failure based on the presence on admission of ICD-9 518.81 and 518.84 as the principal diagnosis or secondary diagnosis, or (4) had a diagnosis of a neuromuscular disorder.
