In recent years the Healthcare system has been facing a problem that caused a significant ammount of loss of life, even though it is not  disease. That problem has been FTRs  (Failiure to Rescue). Many patients that had curable disease died because their condition was wrongly diagnosed, not recognized fast enough, or because there was missing information. This is where this project comes in. It envisions to take the information available in hospitals and order it in a meaningful and easy to interpret way, so that doctors can act faster and more efficiently. On top of that, it also alerts doctors on cases that might be misinterpreted by looking at previous records.
