The core data elements identified in the present report should help direct hospitals to collect the most meaningful data to optimize system interventions and improve clinical outcomes. Identification of supplemental data elements should allow enhanced data collection to further scientific knowledge in these system responses. Standardized data elements and definitions will permit aggregate data analysis, as well as create a consistent nomenclature for publications related to these prevention, early intervention, and response systems. Utstein-style data definitions and reporting templates have helped improve the consistency and comparability of data on cardiac arrest, trauma, and drowning and for this reason are proposed for the MET, RRT, and CCOT. The purpose of the present statement is to create consensus-derived key data elements and definitions and to develop a standardized Utstein-style template for the reporting of data related to systems with response teams such as METs, RRTs, and CCOTs.
